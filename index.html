			<h2>Subtheme: Housing for the Rich</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><b>QUESTION 1:</b> Who is the primary housing market for a city like Boston? Is the market focused on ultra-affluent buyers or an average American household?</li>
					<p>Motivation: In an unparalleled housing crunch in Boston, the article details how the present median sale prices for both single-family homes and condominiums are over three times the median income of Boston households. This situation seems to cater more to wealthier purchasers, with the article noting that these buyers often do not use these high-priced properties as their primary residences, but rather as vacation homes or investment opportunities. <i>For me, this raises the question: is Boston evolving into a city primarily for the ultra-wealthy, or does it still hold a place for the typical American family?</i></p>
				<li><b>QUESTION 2:</b> Are these high-price properties and buildings profitable for Boston as a whole?</li>
					<p>From 2015 to 2021, over 1,000 new condominiums priced at $2 million and above were developed. Affording a $2 million home requires an annual household income of $660,000, a figure that only 1.7% of Boston households meet. During the topping-off ceremony for One Dalton, Marty Walsh highlighted that while luxury developments are not aimed at the lower-income demographic, they still bring benefits, such as generating thousands of construction jobs and contributing millions in property taxes and revenue. These funds support middle-class and low-income housing initiatives in Boston, including the creation of over 8,000 new affordable housing units since 2000. <i>This leads me to ask how profitable are high-priced properties for Boston as a whole.</i></p>
				<li><b>QUESTION 3:</b> How profitable are empty investment properties for society and how profitable would applying a vacancy tax prove to be? </li>
					<p>At One Dalton, approximately 15% of the building's 171 units have not been sold than four years after its opening. Moreover, only 16% of the units at One Dalton have owners who have claimed the residential tax exemption, indicating these are their primary residences. In reality, just a third of the units in the city’s most expensive buildings have owners claiming this exemption. Other cities have turned to tax incentives to tackle this issue, imposing vacancy taxes on corporate landlords with empty residential properties. This strategy led to a 36% decrease in vacant properties in Vancouver from 2017 to 2021. While Mayor Wu is interested in exploring a vacancy tax, her immediate focus is on other critical issues such as housing production and affordability. <i>Real estate groups often resist vacancy taxes, arguing that properties left empty by investors can benefit society. This raises my question: how accurate is this belief?</i></p>

			<h2>Exploration of Datasets</h2>

			<h3>Dataset #1: Condo Conversions in City of Boston 2015-2024</h3>
				<p>This dataset encompasses both Cambridge and Boston, cataloging addresses that have undergone conversion to condos. For each entry, the dataset provides comprehensive details on the condominium conversion, including the address, pre-conversion property class, land area, tax district, residential exemption status, land value, and sale price, alongside corresponding post-conversion values. Additionally, the dataset incorporates data on architectural and design features, such as the type of exterior roofing and interior room count, construction year, and overall condition grade before conversion. Each entry is characterized by a total of 114 distinct variables. The dataset lists more than 285 properties in Cambridge and over 2,245 condominium conversions in Boston.</p>
			<h3>Dataset #2: Corporate Ownership Rates and Owner Occupancy Rates in Boston Neighborhoods, 2004-2024</h3>
				<p>This dataset provides comprehensive data on corporate ownership and demographic changes across 35 different neighborhoods in Boston. It includes metrics such as owner-occupancy rates and corporate ownership rates, tracking their evolution over the last 20 years. Additionally, it contains detailed census data for each neighborhood, covering aspects like the number of college residents, biracial individuals, individuals of Asian American and Pacific Islander descent, total population, Black or African American residents, Hispanic or Latino residents, and housing units, among others. Each neighborhood is described by 39 distinct variables. Notably, I found that the dataset is quite comprehensive because there are no missing values. </p>
